      <h2 class="w3-wide">U.S. Police Violence Web Map</h2><br>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Since 2013, many people of all races, genders, and walks of life have rallied 
        around the sweeping American social movement known as Black Lives Matter. Originally stemming from 
        protest against excessive use of force predominantly targeting Black men by police officers around 
        the United States, community members would take to the streets not only to communicate their 
        dissatisfaction with policing in the United States, but also to memorialize the victims of these 
        extreme uses of force.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> The main focus of this project is to bring back attention to the individual 
        lives that are being taken through police violence. The main feature of this map is to show the 
        exact locations of police violence reports since the beginning of the BLM movement. Users are 
        able to click on the points on the map to see the names, races, and ages of victims of police 
        violence. And if the reader chooses, they may follow a link to a local news article about the 
        police violence report.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> While we do want to focus more on the individual, it is still very important 
        to preserve the part of police reform movements that are pointing out disparities in how policing 
        is done. To do this we are also including statistics for the racial makeup of each state accoording 
        to the American Community Survey, and we are providing a bar chart that shows the racial statistics 
        of all of the instances of police violence on the screen. These two tools in tandem will allow the 
        user to better understand the disparities in policing in the United States.</p>

        <p class="w3-justify">The amount of information on the map may be slightly daunting at first since 
          it shows all 10 years worth of violence reports at once. Users can filter the data points by year 
          using the dropdown in the top left corner (displayed above).

        <p class="w3-justify"> As you can see, looking at an individual year makes viewing the data much more 
          managable. From here we can use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in on an area of interest.

        <p class="w3-justify"> Once the user finds the area of interest, they can use their mouse to click on 
          a point and explore the details of the data associated with said point. When the user clicks, a popup
          will appear on the map showing demographic details of the victim and a brief description of the 
          violence report. If the user would like even further details, they can follow the "Read More" link to
          open an associated news report in a new tab.

            <p class="w3-justify"> The ACS data is a collection of individual observations with multiple attributes to 
              describe an individual taking the survey. These survey results were compiled into proportional demographic 
              data using a simple <a href="https://github.com/phammy22/policing_geodashboard/blob/main/assets/data_cleaning.R">R script</a>.
              These data are then used to make a fill type Mapbox layer.</p>
            <p class="w3-justify"> The data from Mapping Police Violence was already very clean, so the data was usable 
              without any sort of heavy duty processing requirements. Points on the map were frawn with a Mapbox layer 
              using the latitude and longitude fields in the dataset. All demographic and individual data for that point 
              is also taken directly from the data table and formatted into a Mapbox popup for viewing when the reader 
              clicks on a point.</p>
